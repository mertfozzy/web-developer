                    Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero. Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in the United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels. After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns, where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.

                    Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes is a World War II veteran, a former officer of the 107th Infantry Regiment and best friend of Steve Rogers since childhood. Barnes enlisted in the army and assigned into the 107th in 1943. His regiment was captured by HYDRA, where Barnes was given a variant of the Super Soldier Serum by Arnim Zola. Barnes, along with whoever still remained from his regiment, were later rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America during Barnes' absence. Upon joining forces with the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed their Howling Commandos, to battle Red Skull's forces. However, during their attempt to finally capture Zola, in the Austrian Alps, Barnes was caught in their ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from a train. As no body was ever recovered, Barnes had then been presumed deceased.

                    Jonathan F. "John" Walker is a former Captain of the U.S. Army's 75th Rangers Regiment. A highly decorated soldier, Walker was chosen to succeed Steve Rogers as Captain America. However, his aspirations of living up to Rogers' legacy attracted the ire of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in their pursuit of the Flag Smashers, during which he took the Super Soldier Serum after failing to apprehend Karli Morgenthau. When his partner and best friend Lemar Hoskins was killed in action, Walker brutally murdered a surrendering foreign national in public, leading to him being stripped of his mantle and discharged with total loss of rank. Creating his own shield, Walker confronted Morgenthau again in New York City, before abandoning his revenge, and joining Wilson and Barnes in thwarting her attack on the GRC. Recruited by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, he was given a black uniform and rebranded as U.S. Agent.

                    Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson is a former United States Air Force pararescue airman, who left active duty when his wing-man Riley died during combat, instead choosing to help other veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At this time, Wilson had met Captain America and was drawn to his conflict with HYDRA, as Captain America needed help from anyone not associated with S.H.I.E.L.D. since they had been infiltrated by HYDRA. Retaking his title as the Falcon, Wilson had then assisted with destroying all of Alexander Pierce's schemes of world domination. Following their victory against Pierce's HYDRA units, Falcon then agreed to assist Captain America in tracking down the Winter Soldier, who was in fact Captain America's close friend who had been brainwashed.
